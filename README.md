# Project Name

## Authentication with MENR Stack, Redux, and Google OAuth2

### Overview

This project demonstrates a basic authentication system implemented using the MENR stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, React), Redux for state management, and Google OAuth2 for user authentication.

### Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to create accounts by providing necessary details.
- **User Login**: Existing users can log in using their credentials.
- **Google OAuth2**: Users can also log in using their Google accounts.
- **Token-based Authentication**: Secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Redux State Management**: State is managed using Redux for a scalable and maintainable application.

### Technologies Used

- MongoDB: Database for storing user information.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux: State management library for React applications.
- Google OAuth2: External authentication provider for Google accounts.
